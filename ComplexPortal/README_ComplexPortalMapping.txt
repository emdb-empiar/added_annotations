The script extracts the added annotations from Complex portal to EMDB database. Every entry is queried independently with various parameters to check if there is a matching complex available in the complex portal database. The parameters such as EMDB_ID, PDB_ID, UNIPROT_ID is queried first. Then, if author provided sequences are available for the entry than a BLAST (blastp) search is done to extract the most appropriate UNIPROT IDs. Apart from the IDs provided by the author in the header file, the script also uses the information about mapping PDBe to complex portal database by PDBe. Its checks if there is a missing mapping and added if so. This is done because the PDBe updates added annotations more frequently than the complex portal does. So, there is good chance of finding few missing links.
The first method of mapping the complex with IDs are more accurate and the second method using BLAST is less accurate. The output is a tsv format including column names as EMDB_IDS, query parameter, complex ID from complex portal, complex name from complex portal and the method used for querying. 

There is also available option to query with author provided scientific names for the entry. This option is not queued right now.
